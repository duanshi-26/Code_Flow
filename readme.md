# Code Flow

The **Java Code Visualizer** is a web-based tool that allows users to input Java code and step through its execution visually. It helps users understand how Java code works by showing variable states, output, and the current line of execution in each step. This tool is especially useful for students learning Java or anyone looking to debug Java programs interactively.

## Features

- **Step-by-step execution**: Visualize the Java code execution line by line.
- **Real-time variable tracking**: Track variable values and states throughout the execution.
- **Output display**: View the program's output as it executes, simulating how the code interacts with the console.
- **Interactive interface**: User-friendly interface to make the process intuitive and easy to follow.

## Usage

1. Input your Java code in the left panel.
2. Provide any required input values in the right panel (one per line).
3. Click the `Run Code` button to start the execution.
4. Use the `Step Forward` and `Step Back` buttons to navigate through the execution steps.
5. The variable states and output will be updated after each step.

## How it works

The Java Code Visualizer parses and executes Java-like code using JavaScript, simulating the behavior of a real Java environment. It dynamically tracks variable states, outputs, and the current line being executed, providing a visual representation of the code flow and execution process.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
- **Web Browser**: A modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox to run the application.
